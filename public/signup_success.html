          <h3>What is Organ Donation?</h3>
          <p>
            Organ donation is the entire practice of retrieving a human organ from a living or deceased person, who is
            referred to as a Donor, and transplanting it into a recipient. The recipient will be a patient who is
            suffering from organ failure and who will not survive unless she/he receives an organ replacement. The
            process of recovering organs is called Retrieval.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box">
          <h3>What is Tissue Donation?</h3>
          <p>
            Tissue Donation is the process of Retrieving or Procuring tissues from a living or deceased persons, called
            a Donor, and transplanted into the Recipient who needs it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box">
          <h3> Types of organ donations </h3>
          <p>
            Living Organ Donation: This is when you retrieve an organ from a healthy living person and transplant it
            into the body of someone who is suffering from end-stage organ failure. This is commonly done in the case
            of a liver or a kidney failure (because the liver can grow back to its normal size and a donor can survive
            on one kidney).</p>

          <p>

            Deceased Organ Donation: When we talk about pledging your organs for donation or about organ donation
            after death, we are talking about Deceased Organ Donation. This is an organ donation from a person who has
            been declared brain stem dead by a team of authorized doctors at a hospital. A person is said to be brain
            stem dead when there is an irreversible loss of consciousness, absence of brain stem reflexes and
            irreversible loss of the capacity to breathe.

          <h3>Which Organs Can Be Donated?</h3>
          <p>
            Kidneys: Both kidneys can be donated by a deceased donor. On average the lifespan of a transplanted kidney
            is around nine years, but it varies from individual to individual. Of all organs in the human body, the
            demand for kidneys is the highest, and kidneys are the most frequently donated organs. A kidney disease most
            likely affects both kidneys at the same time. A living donor can easily donate one kidney to someone and
            function well for the rest of their lives.</p>
          <p>Liver: The liver is an important organ with primary functions of bile production & excretion; excretion of
            bilirubin, cholesterol, hormones, and drugs; metabolism of fats, proteins and carbohydrates; enzyme
            activation; storage of glycogen, vitamins and minerals; synthesis of plasma proteins; blood detoxification
            and purification. The liver is the only organ in the human body that can grow cells and regenerate. A
            donated liver from someone who has died (a deceased donor) can further be split into two pieces and
            transplanted into two different people to save their lives. A living donor can have a portion of her/his
            liver removed to donate to someone, and the remaining portion will regenerate to almost its full previous
            size.</p>
          <p>Heart: A heart is a muscular organ which pumps blood through the human body. In a person’s life, the heart
            will beat around 2.5 billion times on average and keep the blood running in the body. After being retrieved
            from the donor, a heart can survive for 4-6 hours only.</p>
          <p>Lungs: Single or double-lung transplants can be performed from deceased donors. Additionally, living donors
            can donate a single lobe from the lungs, though it will not regenerate.</p>
          <p>Pancreas: A deceased donor pancreas can be transplanted into an ailing patient. A living donor can also
            donate a portion of the pancreas and still retain pancreas functionality.</p>
          <p>Intestine: After death, a donor can donate their intestine. Although quite rare, a living donor can donate
            a portion of the intestine.

          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box">
          <h3>Which Tissues Can Be Donated?</h3>
          <p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; ">
            Layers of cells that function together to serve a specific purpose are called Tissues. Most Tissues should
            be donated within 6 hours of the donor’s death.</p>

          <p>Cornea: Cornea donation or eye donation is the most common tissue donation. The Cornea is a transparent
            covering over the eye. It is also the eye’s primary focusing element. Recipients who suffer from corneal
            blindness can gain their sight again after a corneal transplant. These patients are those who may have been
            blinded by an accident, infection or disease. Either the entire Cornea can be transplanted or it can be
            transplanted in parts. A Corneal Transplant is does not need any anti-rejection drugs in the recipient.
            Corneas from all ages of recipients are effective as long as the Doctors as they are healthy.</p>
          <p> Bones: Bones from deceased donors are used to replace bones of recipients whose bones are cancerous. A
            Bone transplant can be done instead of amputating the cancerous arm.</p>
          <p>Skin: Skin can be used as grafting for burn victims, acid attack victims or for post-mastectomy breast
            reconstruction, amongst other things.</p>
          <p>Veins: Donated veins are commonly used in surgeries for cardiac bypass.
            Apart from these, other tissues that can be donated are muscles, tendons, ligaments, cartilage and heart
            valves.

          <h3>Law Governing Organ Donation In India</h3>
          <p>
            The primary legislation related to organ donation and transplantation in India, Transplantation of Human
            Organs & Tissues Act, was passed in 1994 and is aimed at regulation of removal, storage and transplantation
            of human organs for therapeutic purposes and for prevention of commercial dealings in human organs.</p>
          <p>
            Some of the main provisions of the Act are as follows:
          <ul>
            <li> Brain stem death identified as a form of death. Process and criteria for brain stem death certification
              defined</li>
            <li>Allows transplantation of human organs and tissues from living donors and cadavers (after cardiac or
              brain
              stem death).</li>
            <li>Regulatory and advisory bodies for monitoring transplantation activity and their constitution defined.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

            <li>The living donor’s medical compatibility is confirmed by a doctor. Only after all the tests have
              positively confirmed that the donor is compatible with the recipient, can the transplant take place.
            </li>
            <li>The living donor’s organs are retrieved surgically by doctors. They will be stored in special chemical
              solutions briefly until they are transplanted into the recipient.</li>
